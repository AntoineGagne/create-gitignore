# `create-ignore`

This is a short program to generate `.gitignore` files from the `gitignore.io` API.

## Prerequisite

To install this program, you will need the [`stack`](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/) package manager.

## Installation

Assuming you have the `stack` package manager, you can simply run:

```sh
stack install
```

Then, you can call the program by calling its name `create-gitignore`.
